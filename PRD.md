# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# Autonomous Multi-Agent Financial Research & Intelligence System

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Financial analysts manually:
- check stock prices
- read multiple news articles
- summarize information
- prepare daily reports

This process is:
- slow
- repetitive
- not scalable

There is a need for an automated AI system that can collect financial data, analyze it, and generate reports with minimal human effort.

---

## 2. Goal

Build an Agentic AI system that:

- fetches stock data automatically
- collects related news
- summarizes insights using LLMs
- performs sentiment analysis
- generates structured reports
- displays everything in a dashboard

---

## 3. Target Users

Primary:
- finance students
- retail investors
- analysts

Secondary:
- research teams
- investment firms (simulation)

---

## 4. Success Metrics

Project is successful if:

- Report generated in < 10 seconds
- Summaries are relevant and readable
- Works for multiple stocks
- Fully automated pipeline
- Multi-agent workflow implemented
- Stable demo

---

## 5. Scope

### In Scope
- Stock API integration
- News API integration
- LLM summarization
- Sentiment analysis
- Report generation
- FastAPI backend
- Streamlit dashboard
- Multi-agent pipeline

### Out of Scope
- Training ML models
- Stock price prediction
- Trading bots
- Complex deep learning research
- Fancy UI

---

## 6. Functional Requirements

### FR1 – Stock Data Retrieval
System must:
- accept stock ticker
- fetch latest price
- fetch basic metrics

Output:
{
  "price": 180.2,
  "change": 1.3
}

---

### FR2 – News Collection
System must:
- fetch top N articles
- extract headlines and content

---

### FR3 – Summarization Agent
System must:
- summarize multiple articles
- generate 3–5 line summary

---

### FR4 – Sentiment Agent
System must:
- classify sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
- provide confidence score

---

### FR5 – Report Agent
System must:
- combine price + news + sentiment
- generate structured financial report

Example:

Stock: AAPL  
Price: $180  
Sentiment: Positive  
Summary: ...  

---

### FR6 – Dashboard
User must:
- input stock ticker
- view report
- view past reports

---

### FR7 – Multi-Agent Workflow
System must include:
- Data Agent
- Analysis Agent
- Report Agent

Agents execute sequentially.
